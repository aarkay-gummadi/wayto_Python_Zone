Python Operators Assignment
------------------------------

* In this assignment, you will explore various Python operators and their usage. 
* Please complete the following tasks.

### Task 1: Arithmetic Operators
* Create two variables a and b with numeric values.
* Calculate the sum, difference, product, and quotient of a and b.
* Print the results.

### Task 2: Comparison Operators
* Compare the values of a and b using the following comparison operators: <, >, <=, >=, ==, and !=.
* Print the results of each comparison.

### Task 3: Logical Operators
* Create two boolean variables, x and y.
* Use logical operators (and, or, not) to perform various logical operations on x and y.
* Print the results.

### Task 4: Assignment Operators
* Create a variable total and initialize it to 10.
* Use assignment operators (+=, -=, *=, /=) to update the value of total.
* Print the final value of total.

### Task 5: Bitwise Operators (Optional)
* If you are comfortable with bitwise operators, perform some bitwise operations on integer values and print the results. If not, you can skip this task.

### Task 6: Identity and Membership Operators
* Create a list my_list containing a few elements.
* Use identity operators (is and is not) to check if two variables are the same object.
* Use membership operators (in and not in) to check if an element is present in my_list.
* Print the results.
