Syntax of Python
----------------
* Certainly! Letâ€™s explore the syntax of Python. Python is known for its readability and straightforward syntax. Here are some essential aspects:
* Indentation:
    * Python uses indentation to indicate code blocks (such as loops, conditionals, and functions).
    * Unlike other languages where indentation is for readability only, in Python, it is critical for defining the structure.
    * Example:
    ```py
    if 5 > 2:
        Print("Five is greter than two!")
    ```
    * The number of spaces is flexible (commonly four), but consistency within the same block is essential.   

* Variables:
    * Variables are created when you assign a value to them.
    * No need for explicit variable declaration.
    * Example:
    ```py
    x = 5
    y = "Hello, World!"
    ```

* Comments:
    * Use # for comments.
    * Comments are for in-code documentation.
    * Example:
    ```py
    # This is a comment.
    print("Hello, World!")
    ```

* Running Python Code:
    *     You can execute Python code directly in the Command Line:
    ```
    print("Hello, World!")
    ```
    * Output:
    ```
    Hello, World!
    ```
    * Or create a Python file (with a .py extension) and run it from the terminal:
    ```
    C:\Users\YourName> python test.py

    ```
