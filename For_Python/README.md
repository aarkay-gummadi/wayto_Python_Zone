Python
------

* Python is a high-level, interpreted, and object-oriented programming language. Let’s explore its key aspects:

### What is Python?
* ython is a versatile programming language widely used in the software industry.
* Its easiest syntax makes it an excellent choice for beginners entering the field of software engineering.
* Key properties: 
    * Interpreted: Python code is executed line by line, making it easy to debug and modify.
    * Object-oriented: It supports object-oriented programming paradigms.
    * High-level: Python abstracts low-level details, allowing developers to focus on solving problems.

### History of Python
* Created in the 1980s by Guido van Rossum during his research in the Netherlands.
* First version released in 1991 with basic functionality.
* Popularity grew among scientists for numerical computations and data analysis.
* Subsequent versions added features and improved performance:
    * Python 1.0 (1991): Basic data types and functionality.
    * Python 1.5 (1997): Enhanced features.
    * Python 2.0 (2000): Further improvements.
    * Python 3.0 (2008): Major changes, including better syntax.
    * Python 3.11 (2022): The latest version.

### Uses and Applications of Python
